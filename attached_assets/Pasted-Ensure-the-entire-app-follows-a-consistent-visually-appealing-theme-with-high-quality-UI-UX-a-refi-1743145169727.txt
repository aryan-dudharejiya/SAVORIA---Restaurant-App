Card-based layout for menu items, orders, and featured dishes.

✅ 🖼️ Image & Visual Styling

Use high-resolution food images to make the app visually appealing.

All images should be properly optimized (WebP format, lazy loading).

Ensure images are rounded (border-radius: 12px) for a softer look.

Rounded buttons (border-radius: 8px) for a modern look.

Primary CTA Buttons (Order Now, Checkout, Book Table): Solid Deep Red with hover effects.

✅ 🖥️ Navigation & Footer Consistency

Navbar should be sticky for easy navigation.

Footer should be well-structured:

Quick links (Home, Menu, Order, Contact).

Social media icons with hover effects.

Newsletter signup for engagement.

✅ 📱 Mobile & Tablet Responsiveness

Ensure mobile-friendly layouts using Flexbox/Grid.

Cart, Menu, and Checkout pages should be optimized for mobile users.

Tap-friendly buttons & larger fonts for better mobile UX.

Implement smooth scrolling & page transitions (scroll-behavior: smooth).

Use lazy loading for images and animations to prevent lag.

Ensure consistent animations (0.3s ease-in-out transitions).
