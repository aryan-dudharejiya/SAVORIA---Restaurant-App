Ensure the Menu Page seamlessly matches the overall theme of the app. Apply a consistent color scheme, typography, layout structure, and UI/UX refinements to align it with the rest of the website. Improve visual appeal, readability, and responsiveness while maintaining a high-end, appetizing look. Implement the following updates:

📋 Menu Page Styling & Enhancements
✅ 🎨 Color Scheme (Match Overall Theme)

Background: Use a soft, warm beige (#FFF7E6) or light cream (#FAF5E9) for a premium, inviting look.

Text Color: Ensure text is dark brown (#3D2C2E) for readability and aesthetic consistency.

Card & Section Colors: Use subtle light gray (#F7F7F7) with rounded borders (border-radius: 12px).

Hover Effects: Apply a slight shadow effect (box-shadow: 0px 4px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1)) to highlight menu items.

✅ 🖋️ Typography (Consistent with Overall App)

Headings (Menu Categories, Titles): "Poppins" (bold, 2rem) → Clean & modern.

Menu Item Names: "Inter" (semi-bold, 1.5rem) → Readable & elegant.

Descriptions: "Roboto" (regular, 1rem) → Simple and user-friendly.

Price Display: "Poppins" (semi-bold, 1.25rem) → Highlighted for clarity.

✅ 📏 Layout & Card Design

Grid-based layout (CSS Grid or Flexbox) for a structured and organized menu display.

Two-column layout for larger screens, switching to one-column for mobile.

Cards for each menu item with a consistent size and spacing (padding: 16px, margin: 12px).

Food images should be high-quality, with a border-radius: 12px and soft shadows.

✅ 🔘 Buttons & CTAs (Consistent with App Theme)

"Add to Cart" button should be Deep Red (#D72638) with a hover transition.

"View Details" should be a secondary button (outline, Warm Orange #FF914D) with smooth transition effects.

Spacing between buttons and text should be consistent (margin-top: 10px).

✅ 🖼️ Image Styling & Optimization

Use high-resolution food images (WebP format, lazy loading enabled).

Ensure all images have uniform aspect ratios for consistency.

Apply rounded corners (border-radius: 12px) and hover zoom effect (scale(1.05)).

✅ 📱 Mobile & Tablet Responsiveness

Ensure the layout adapts properly for smaller screens (flex-wrap: wrap).

Tap-friendly buttons & larger fonts for an improved mobile experience.

📌 Apply these refinements to ensure the Menu Page perfectly matches the overall app theme and provides a polished, high-end, user-friendly experience. Confirm once the updates are done! 🚀
